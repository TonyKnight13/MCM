各种生产量:
- CLPRB Coal production in billion Btu
- PAPRB Crude oil production in billion Btu
- NGMPB  Marketed natural gas production, billion Btu, by state
- REPRB = Renewable energy production, billion Btu

## cocal

- CLPRPZZ = Coal production, thousand short tons, by state; and
- CLPRKZZ = Factor for converting coal production from thousand short tons to billion Btu, by state.

10亿Btu的煤产量由以下公式计算
- CLPRBZZ = CLPRPZZ * CLPRKZZ

美国的总产量，CLPRPUS和CLPRBUS，被计算为国家价值的总和。而美国的平均换算系数为
- CLPRKUS = CLPRBUS / CLPRPUS

## crude oil

- PAPRPZZ = Crude oil production (including lease condensate), thousand barrels, by state or federal offshore region; and
- COPRKUS = Factor for converting crude oil production from thousand barrels to billion Btu

10亿Btu原油产量由以下公式计算:
- PAPRBZZ = PAPRPZZ * COPRKUS

美国的总产量，PAPRPUS和PAPRBUS，被计算为各州和联邦离岸地区的价值总和。

The U.S. total production, PAPRPUS and PAPRBUS, are calculated as the sum of the values for the states and federal offshore regions.

##  Natural Gas (Marketed Production)

- NGPRPZZ = Dry natural gas production, million cubic feet, by state or federal offshore GOM;
- NGTCKZZ = Factor for converting dry natural gas production from million cubic feet to billion Btu, by state or federal offshore GOM;
- NGELPZZ = NGPL production, gaseous equivalent, million cubic feet, by state; and
- NGELKZZ = Factor for converting NGPL production, gaseous equivalent, from million cubic feet to billion Btu, by state.

Dry production and NGPL production in Btu are calculated:

- NGPRBZZ = NGPRPZZ * NGTCKZZ
- NGELBZZ = NGELPZZ * NGELKZZ

市场生产是干生产和NGPL生产的总和:
Marketed production is the sum of dry production and NGPL production:
- NGMPPZZ = Marketed natural gas production, million cubic feet, by state
- = NGPRPZZ + NGELPZZ
- NGMPBZZ = Marketed natural gas production, billion Btu, by state
- = NGPRBZZ + NGELBZZ
- NGMPKZZ = Derived conversion factor for marketed production
- = NGMPBZZ / NGMPPZZ


1960至1969年，独立数据系列为:
- NGMPPZZ =市场上的天然气产量，百万立方英尺，按国家计算。

根据1970年国家层面的换算因子，估计了市场生产的Btu含量:
- NGMPBZZ * 1970的NGMPKZZ。

美国市场的生产，NGMPPUS和NGMPBUS，被计算为各州和联邦海外GOM的价值之和，而美国的换算因子NGMPKUS，则是用同样的公式得出的。

For 1960 through 1969, the independent data series is:
- NGMPPZZ = Marketed natural gas production, million cubic feet, by state.
The Btu content of marketed production is estimated using the state-level conversion factors for 1970:
- NGMPBZZ = NGMPPZZ * 1970’s NGMPKZZ

## Renewable Energy and Nuclear Energy

- ENPRPUS = Fuel ethanol production, including denaturant, thousand barrels, United States;
- ENPRPZZ = Fuel ethanol production, including denaturant, thousand barrels, by state;
- EMPRPUS = Fuel ethanol production, excluding denaturant, thousand barrels, United States; and
- EMLCBUS = Losses and co-products from the production of fuel ethanol, billion Btu, United States

10亿Btu的热含量数据序列定义如下:

The heat content data series in billion Btu are defined as follows:

- EMPRPZZ = Fuel ethanol production, excluding denaturant, thousand barrels, by state
- = ENPRPZZ * (EMPRPUS / ENPRPUS)
- EMPRBZZ = Fuel ethanol production, excluding denaturant, billion Btu, by state
- = EMPRPZZ * 3.539
- EMLCBZZ = Losses and co-products from fuel ethanol production, billion Btu, by state
- = EMLCBUS * (EMPRBZZ / EMPRBUS)
- EMFDBZZ = Biomass inputs to the production of fuel ethanol
- = EMPRBZZ + EMLCBZZ

The U.S. totals are calculated as the sum of the states’ values.



The independent data series identifying codes for renewable energy data are as follows (the two-letter state code is
represented by “ZZ” in the variable names):
- GETCBZZ = Geothermal energy total consumption, billion Btu;
- HYTCBZZ = Conventional hydroelectric power total consumption, billion Btu;
- SOTCBZZ = Solar thermal and photovoltaic energy total consumption, billion Btu;
- WYTCBZZ = Wind energy total consumption, billion Btu; and
- WWTCBZZ = Wood and biomass waste energy total consumption, billion Btu.

Renewable energy production series in billion Btu are defined as follows:
- ROPRBZZ = Renewable energy production, other than fuel ethanol, billion Btu
- = GETCBZZ + HYTCBZZ + SOTCBZZ + WYTCBZZ + WWTCBZZ
- REPRBZZ = Renewable energy production, billion Btu
- = EMFDBZZ + ROPRBZZ

The U.S. totals are calculated as the sum of the states’ values.
