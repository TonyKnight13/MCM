各位州长，毫无疑问各州之间制定能源协议，实现能源互补是重要的。

Governors, there is no doubt that energy agreements between the states are important to achieve energy complementarity.

首先我们分析了你们各个州能源的历史状况。你们各个州从1960年到2009年的能源状况有相似的地方也有不同的地方。相同的地方是，从上世纪60年代开始，随着经济总量的不断增长和各种产业结构的完善，对能源的需求量不断提高，并且几乎消耗了大量比重的化石能源，但很高兴地看到从本世纪初开始到最近几年你们都开始大力发展可再生能源。这使得可再生能源消耗占总能源消耗的比重不断提高。而不同的是由于地理环境、气候等因素影响，你们的可再生能源重点开发的种类不同。加利福尼亚州对地热能的开发较好，新墨西哥州和德克萨斯州对风能的开发较好，亚利桑那州则是太阳能和燃料乙醇的开发较好。

First, we analyzed the history of energy in each of your states.  There are similar places in your states from 1960 to 2009. In the same place, the demand for energy has been increasing since the 1960s, with the continuous growth of the economy and the improvement of various industrial structures. Your states nearly consumes a large proportion of fossil energy, but it's very glad to see that from the beginning of this century to the recent years you've all developed renewable energy. This increases the proportion of renewable energy consumption to total energy consumption. 
The difference is that due to the geographical environment, climate and other factors, the development of renewable energy in each state is different. California is good at geothermal energy development, while New Mexico and Texas develop wind energy better, while Arizona is better at developing solar and fuel ethanol.

我们对各个州的能源使用情况进行了预测，我们得出结论，在没有任何新的政策下，你们各州能源状况都会出现问题。具体来说随着城市的发展，你们对能源的需求都将会大大提高。根据当前各州新能源发展的状况，亚利桑那州和加利福尼亚州可能会出现能源匮乏的问题，所需能源将几乎依赖于进口能源，而新墨西哥州和德克萨斯州会出现能源剩余的情况。在这里我们夸大了化石能源的储存量，如果随着化石能源的不断枯竭，你们对能源的需求会更加紧迫。

We has made the forecast for the energy usage in each state, and we concluded that without any new policy, there will be problems in the energy status of your states.
Specifically with the development of cities, your demand for energy will be greatly improved. According to the current state of new energy development in each state, Arizona and California may face the problem of energy shortage, the energy required will be almost dependent on imported energy sources. While New Mexico and Texas will have energy surplus situation.
Here we exaggerate the energy storage of fossil fuels, and your need for energy will be more urgent if the fossil energy is exhausted.

根据我们的预测和分析，我们将为你们提供关于能源合同目标的建议。首先对于能源合同的目标，你们应该尽量实现各州的全面发展。这要求了你们要实现四个州内部的资源互补，实现最大的经济效益。具体来说，德克萨斯州和新墨西哥州将多余的可再生能源传输给亚利桑那州和加利福尼亚州。加大可再生能源的传输，而减少化石等不可再生能源的传输，这样会使得你们的能源结构更加优化。各个州应该在现在的能源状况基础上继续大力发展可再生能源，因为这不仅是经济效益的问题，对环境的影响也将是巨大的。另外你们也可以适当扩大合作州的数量，这样有助于更优的发展。

Based on our forecasts and analysis, we will advise you on the goals of energy contracts. First of all, you should try your best to realize the comprehensive development of the energy contract. This requires you to realize the complementary resources inside the four states, to achieve maximum economic benefits. Specifically, Texas and New Mexico transfer excess renewable energy to Arizona and California.
It is necessary to increase the transmission of renewable energy and reduce the transmission of non-renewable energy such as fossil fuels, which will make your energy structure more optimized.
Every state should continue to vigorously develop renewable energy on the basis of the current energy situation, because it is not only an economic benefit, but also a huge impact on the environment. In addition, you can expand the number of cooperative states appropriately, which will contribute to better development.

感谢你们花时间阅读本说明，以及你们不懈努力的工作。

Thank you for taking the time to read this note and your tireless work.
