能源的生产、消耗可以看作一个重要的经济指标，反映了一个国家的工业发展，关系到一个国家的命脉。但另一方面，随着人类文明工业化的不断推进与深化，不可再生的能源如煤炭，石油的消耗也在加快，因而更清洁的可再生能源发展显得尤为重要，毕竟如果人类过度依赖不可再生资源，那么在化石燃料耗尽的那天，也是人类重归农耕社会的一天。作为世界超级大国，美国的很多能源政策分权到州的层次，为了便于管理，简化处理流程，州与州之间制定了契约。在这样的背景下，沿着美国与墨西哥边界的4个州，加利福利亚，亚利桑那州，新墨西哥州，德克萨斯州希望建立一个聚焦于愈加广泛使用，更清洁，可再生的能源的契约。

Energy production and energy consumption, which can be regarded as an important economic index, not only reflect the industrial development of a country but also relate to the lifehood of a country. But on the other hand, with the continuous advancement and deepening of the industrialization of human civilization, the consumption of non-renewable energy sources such as coal, petroleum is also accelerating. Hence, the development of cleaner renewable energy is particularly important. After all, if humans depend too much on non-renewable energy sources, the day when fossil fuels are depleted is also a day for humankind to return to agrarian society.
As the world's superpower, many of America's energy policy decentralizes to the state level. to ensure cooperative action between the states\cite{州际契约}, many compacts are formed between states. In this context, along the border with Mexico four states, California, Arizona, new Mexico, Texas hope to form a new energy compact focused on more and more widely used, cleaner renewable energy sources.

在这四个州的州长要求下，我们需要完成以下任务：
At the request of the governors of these four states, we need to complete the following tasks:
-  Create an energy profile for each of the four states.
-  Make governors easier to understand the four states’ usage of cleaner, renewable energy sources  and the similarities and difference between the four states.
-  Determine a state that is appeared to have the "best" profile for use of cleaner, renewable energy in 2009.
-  Predict the energy profile of each state in 2025 and 2050.
-  Determine renewable energy usage targets for 2025 and 2050 which are also for the new four-state energy compact.
-  Provide at least three suggestions about how to meet the energy compact goals.
