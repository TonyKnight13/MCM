为了描述四个州的能源状况，首先我们通过自己定义一个描述能源整体状况的的指标。能源与经济、环境存在着互相影响、互相制约的关系，所以我们采用清洁能源消耗占所有能源消耗的比例、GDP以及二氧化碳排放量三种数据来表示我们的指标【《能源-经济-环境（3E）系统协调度评价模型研究》】。清洁能源状况好，意味着其在该州所有能源消耗中所占比例高，该州的二氧化碳排放量少，以及产生更好的经济效益。

To describe the energy situation of the four states, we first define an indicator that describes the overall state of energy.
Due to the mutual influence and mutual restraint between energy and economy and environment, we use the data of clean energy consumption accounts for the proportion of all energy consumption, GDP and carbon dioxide emissions to represent our indicators.
Clean energy in good condition means that it has a high share of all energy consumption in the state, less carbon dioxide in the state, and better economics.

First, we standardize on the three types of data. We use the range method to standardize. Formula is as follows:

For positive indicators,
<!-- 公式1 -->

For negative indicators,
<!-- 公式2 -->

We assume that energy, economy and environment are equally important to our indicators, so the formula is
<!-- 公式3 -->

The larger the indicator, the better the clean energy situation. Among them, due to the positive carbon dioxide emissions, so the actual calculation to take the opposite treatment.
We make a statistical analysis of the energy status indicators of each state from 1980 to 2009, and make the time sequence diagram of energy status indicators in different states, as shown below.

As we can see, the beginning of the rapid economic growth, the index is increasing. But because of the environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions, the number of states began to decline around 1987. Then, with the idea of sustainable development strengthened, each state proposed its own new energy policy, and the index began to increase. Here you can see Texas and New Mexico due to the development of new energy, their indicators of increased speed is relatively obvious.

In addition, since there is a large amount of data in each state that affects the similarities and differences between the states, we analyzed the renewable energy status in each of the four states by making time series diagram of different states.

AZ

We chart the development trends of various renewable energy categories in Arizona over the past 50 years, as shown below.

We can see that Arizona has a relatively early development of hydropower and has a high proportion of all renewable energy, and wood and waste energy are secondary. Other renewable sources of energy began to develop in the 1980s and 1990s. Fuel ethanol and solar power are growing rapidly, and by 2009, fuel ethanol consumption exceeded wood and waste consumption, making it the second largest consumption of renewable energy.

An analysis of Arizona's geography and climate shows that Arizona has abundant solar energy resources, averaging 300 sunny days a year. However, due to the long-term high cost of photovoltaic energy, the growth rate has gradually slowed down after the initial rapid growth. The current cost of photovoltaic energy is estimated at 0.15-0.25 dollars / kWh, so the development is not satisfactory.

Although the wind energy in Arizona is developing slowly, its development prospects are good. The larger contiguous areas of good-to-excellent resource are located in northern and eastern Arizona close to the eastern edge of the Mogollon Rim. Good-to-excellent wind resources are also found on the higher rims and ridge crests throughout the state.

CA 

We chart the trends in various renewable energy categories in California over the past 50 years, as shown below.

<!-- 图    亚利桑那州各类可再生能源时间序列图 -->

The figure shows that California's total renewable energy consumption is huge. Renewable energy consumption is similar to Arizona's, and is the highest proportion of all renewable energy sources, followed by wood and waste. Other renewable sources of energy have been growing since the 1980s and 1990s, with fuel ethanol growing fastest. Unlike other sources of energy, California's geothermal energy has grown earlier and consumed much more.

Analyzing the state of California, you can see that the eastern part of California, especially the southern tip and the northeast end is a desert, so there may be more geothermal energy. In addition, due to the large population, there are also many energy consumption.

NM

We plot the trends in various renewable energy categories in New Mexico over the past 50 years as shown below.

<!-- 图    新墨西哥州各类可再生能源时间序列图 -->

Can see the state's total renewable energy consumption less. By 2005, the largest share of renewable energy was wood and waste. Wind energy has grown rapidly since 2005, making it the biggest consumption of renewable energy.

TX

We plot the trends in various renewable energy categories in Texas over the past 50 years as shown below.
It can be seen that Texas is very much like New Mexico in the use of wind energy and wood and waste.
Analysis of Texas data found that at present Texas is the largest state in the United States with the highest wind energy generation and this value is still growing due to the state's renewables portfolio standard (RPS), which forces RPS Power suppliers proactively use large-scale wind and other renewable energy to generate electricity.
