灰度预测模型评价
优点：
    1.模型简单，易于实现
    2.模型的计算采用专业的数学分析软件，可行度较高
    3.建立的指标考虑了众多因素，综合性较高
缺点：
    1.预测模型过于简单，不能很好的预测数据
    2.对于本问题，所引入的外部资料比较多，自己创造的东西较少
    3.未投入太多时间对该部分模型进行修改，并且中心不够突出
改进方法：
    1.对于2009年以前的数据我们可以结合政府政策、经济危机和新能源技术突破等来进行分析，找到导致各能源关于时间序列的曲线波动较大的原因，进而使曲线更加平滑。
    2.对于目标优化问题，可以考虑州与州之间的传输成本，使得模型更接近实际情况

## Model evaluation

Advantages
1. The model is simple and easy to implement.
2. The model is calculated using a professional mathematical analysis software, a higher degree of feasibility.
3. The indicators set up take into account a number of factors and are highly integrated.

Disadvantages
1. The prediction model is too simple to predict well.
2. For this problem, there are more external data introduced, and fewer things are created by ourself.
3. Not devoting too much time to modify the part of the model, and the center is not prominent enough.

Improved method
1. For 2009's and previous data, we can combine them with the government policies, the economic crisis and new energy technology breakthroughs to analyze and find the causes of the energy fluctuations in the time series curve, thus making the curve smoother.
2. For the goal optimization problem, we can consider the transmission costs between states and make the model closer to the actual situation.
