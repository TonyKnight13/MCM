我们从Energy Consumption, Energy Prices, Energy Expenditures, Energy Production这四个方面做出了四个州1960-2009年这50年来的能源概况。如下图所示。
值得注意的是，下图的图片标签均为5位字符串，其中第一二位为各州的简写，其他三位，根据（参考）和（参考）的说明，第三四位的PR指生产量，TC是指总消费；第五位是变量类型，B是consumption in British thermal units (Btu) ,D是price in dollars per million Btu,V是expenditure in million dollars。此外，曲线代表着各种能源随着时间发生的变化。

We make an energy profile for the four states from 1960 to 2009 in the past 50 years, which covers four aspects of energy consumption, energy prices, energy expenditures, energy production.As shown in the following figures.
(Note that the following figures labels are five-character series names.The first two letters  represent state code. According to the\cite{} and \cite{}, the third and fourth letters like 'TC' means total consumption and 'PR' means product; the fifth letter represents the type of data such as 'B' means consumption in British thermal units (Btu), 'D' means price in dollars per million Btu and 'V' means expenditure in million dollars.Furthemore, the curve represents the change in energy over time.)
