 #灰色预测
    We use the GM(1,1) model to forecast time-series. GM(1,1) is one of the models of gray theory, which has been 
utilized in many areas such as the power industry\cite{}.The process of developing the model is shown below.
    The sequence of time-series data is assumed to be
    \[X^{(0)}=\{X^{(0)}(1),X^{(0)}(2),X^{(0)}(3),...,X^{0}(n)\}\]
where n represents the total number of time-series data.
    use an accumulated generation operation(AGO) on the sequence to get a new squence
    \[X^{(1)}(k) = \sum^k_{i=1}X^{(0)}(i),\quad k=1,2,...,n\]
    Therefore, the new squence is
    \[X^{(1)}=\{X^{(1)}(1),X^{(1)}(2),X^{(1)}(3),...,X^{1}(n)\]
    The grey differential equation is ued to develop the GM(1,1) model
    \[X^{(0)}(k) + ay^{(1)}(k)=u\]
    where $a$ is the development coefficient; $y^{(0)}$ represents the 
    mean generation with consecutive neighbors sequence of $X^{(1)}$ and its define as,
    \[y^{(1)}(k) = \frac12\times\left[y^{(1)}(k) + y^{(1)}(k-1)\right],\quad k=1,2,...,n\]
    use the ordinary least squares method, first-order AGO sequence can be obtained as,
    \[X^{(1)}(k)=\left(X^{(0)}(1)-\frac{\hat{u}}{\hat{a}}\right)\times e^{-\hat{a}(k-1)}+\frac{\hat{u}}{\hat{a}}\]
    where $\left[\hat{a},\hat{u}\right]^T$ is equal to $\left(C^TC\right)^{-1}C^TX$
    and
    \[C=\begin{bmatrix}-y^{(1)}(2)&1\\-y^{(1)}(3)&1\\...&...\\-y^{(1)}(n)&1\end{bmatrix}\]
    \[X = \left[X^{(0)}(2),X^{(0)}(2),...,X^{(0)}(n)\right]^T\]

    根据以上的灰度预测模型，
